The design of the Android application will only be described briefly as the Kenyan team had the sole responsibility. Figure \ref{fig:mock} displays a mockup of the application. This was made by the Kenyan and displays a room with four exits and two occupants. The intention was that the application should request data about the room from the server using commands. These commands are described in section \ref{sec:design_server}.
