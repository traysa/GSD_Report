Figure~\ref{fig:system_overview} displays the different components in the system and how they relate and communicate with each other.

As we can see, the system primarily consists of 4 components:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Web cameras,
	\item Raspberry Pi computers,
	\item The server,
	\item and the Android application.
\end{enumerate}

All of these components are discussed further on in the respective chapters.
